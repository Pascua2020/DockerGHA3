( Docker, GitHub Actions, Java Spring Boot, and Dokku )

![DevOps Logo](https://globalittrainers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Devops-logo1.png)

```diff
- This project demonstrates how to integrate Docker, GitHub Actions, Java Spring Boot, and Dokku to create an automated development and deployment workflow.

- The application is a basic Spring Boot service running inside a Docker container, automated with GitHub Actions, and deployed using Dokku.
```

## 1️⃣🟥 Features

#### *⚡️ Docker:*

![Docker Logo](https://dwglogo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Docker_container_engine_logo.png)

Packages the Spring Boot application in a container to ensure it runs consistently in any environment.

#### *⚡️ GitHub Actions:*

![GHA Logo](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1075/0*w5Fsp29pbWIUpW7Q.png)

Automates the build, test, and deployment processes for the application with each change in the repository.

#### *⚡️ Java Spring Boot:*

![Java SB Logo](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*MvUFlFTbiU40ae1SK69-Jg.png)

Backend framework for web application development.

#### *⚡️ Dokku:*

![Dokku Logo](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6mNvZ4G3tFQpY1qcVDQdWGSVUW5ljKhyUxfgTeFAZUX5r48Xm8M6mMf55h3IkCw1DC3ERygHIWgsvguq1cYntoluBXdW4-7W_Uhw8JHrvQIeW5T1lIGOuk7WTvkP5O-M_XR4J-6W9Gg-vfhG6B-Q6w75EaJ_eHlGvjxcbEGB3_xckw6OnTwxuBWsL-TRQ/s2800/A%20Deep%20Dive%20with%20Dokku.webp)

A Heroku-like deployment platform that uses Docker containers to manage applications easily.

### Differences between DockerGHA 1, 2, 3, and 4:

#### ⚠️ *All Dockerfiles are identical:*

- Use the base image busybox:latest.

- Copy a run.sh script into the container, which prints the current time in the console in an infinite loop.

- Configure the run.sh script as the container's entry point.


#### ⚠️ *Main.yml - General differences:*

*ℹ️ 1. Repositories:*


- 1 and 2 push images only to Docker Hub.

- 3 pushes only to GHCR.

- 4 pushes to both registries (Docker Hub and GHCR).


*ℹ️ 2. Automation:*

- Repositories 2, 3, and 4 use docker/metadata-action for automatic tagging, while 1 does not.


*ℹ️ 3. Image names:*

- Repository 1 has a fixed name: clockbox:latest.

- The other repositories use dynamic or specific configurations.

## 3️⃣🟩 Objectives of the Project

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the use of Docker, GitHub Actions, and Dokku in a unified DevOps workflow for building, testing, and deploying applications.

This workflow is highly modular and follows standard practices to ensure scalability and automation:

Containerize the application using Docker.

Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

Automate deployment processes via Dokku.

## 4️⃣🟨 Technologies Used

▫️ *Backend:*

💡Java Spring Boot: Provides a framework for developing microservices and REST APIs.

▫️ *Containers:*

💡Docker: Used to create, deploy, and run the application in containers, ensuring consistency across environments.

▫️ *Automation:*

💡GitHub Actions: Configured to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

▫️ *Deployment:*

💡Dokku: Used to manage and deploy the application to a virtualized environment, simplifying application hosting.

▫️ *Others:*

💡Nginx: Used as a reverse proxy for the application to enhance performance and security.

## ⬜️ Code

#### 💡 *Dockerfile*
```
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM busybox:latest
COPY --chmod=755 <<EOF /app/run.sh
#!/bin/sh
while true; do
  echo -ne "The time is now $(date +%T)\\r"
  sleep 1
done
EOF

ENTRYPOINT /app/run.sh
```

This Dockerfile creates a lightweight container image using the busybox:latest base image.

*🔷️ Steps:*

▫️ 1. Specify Base Image:

The image is built using the busybox:latest image, which is a minimal Linux distribution optimized for small size and basic functionality.

▫️ 2. Create and Copy a Shell Script:

A shell script is written inline directly into the Dockerfile using a heredoc syntax (<<EOF).

The script (run.sh) is copied into the /app directory inside the container.

The script is given executable permissions (chmod=755).

▫️ 3. Shell Script Functionality:

The script continuously:

Prints the current time (HH:MM:SS) to the terminal.

Overwrites the previous output (\r ensures the same line is updated).

Pauses for 1 second between updates (sleep 1).

▫️ 4. Set the Entrypoint:

The container is configured to execute /app/run.sh automatically when it starts.

### *🔑 Purpose:*

This Dockerfile creates a container that continuously displays the current time in real-time. It demonstrates how to create a minimal, self-contained application using a simple base image like busybox.

#### 💡 *Main.yml*
```
#
name: Create and publish a Docker image

# Configures this workflow to run every time a change is pushed to the branch called `release`.
on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

# Defines two custom environment variables for the workflow. These are used for the Container registry domain, and a name for the Docker image that this workflow builds.
env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}

# There is a single job in this workflow. It's configured to run on the latest available version of Ubuntu.

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # Uses the `docker/login-action` action to log in to the Container registry registry using the account and password that will publish the packages. Once published, the packages are scoped to the account defined here.

      # This step uses [docker/metadata-action](https://github.com/docker/metadata-action#about) to extract tags and labels that will be applied to the specified image. The `id` "meta" allows the output of this step to be referenced in a subsequent step. The `images` value provides the base name for the tags and labels.

      # This step uses the `docker/build-push-action` action to build the image, based on your repository's `Dockerfile`. If the build succeeds, it pushes the image to GitHub Packages.
      # It uses the `context` parameter to define the build's context as the set of files located in the specified path. For more information, see "[Usage](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action#usage)" in the README of the `docker/build-push-action` repository.
      # It uses the `tags` and `labels` parameters to tag and label the image with the output from the "meta" step.

This main.yml file defines a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes a Docker image to a container registry (GitHub Container Registry).

Workflow Overview:

*🔷️ 1. Name:*

The workflow is titled Create and publish a Docker image.

*🔷️ 2. Trigger:*

The workflow runs whenever there is a push event to the main branch.

*🔷️ 3. Environment Variables:*

REGISTRY: Specifies the container registry domain (ghcr.io for GitHub Container Registry).

IMAGE_NAME: Dynamically assigns the Docker image name based on the repository name (${{ github.repository }}).

Job Details:

Job Name:

build-and-push-image.

Runs On:

Executes on the latest version of Ubuntu (ubuntu-latest).

Permissions:

Grants read access to the repository content and write access to the package registry using the GITHUB_TOKEN.

*🔷️ Steps:*

▫️ 1. Checkout Repository:

Uses the actions/checkout action to fetch the repository files into the workflow environment.

▫️ 2. Log In to the Container Registry:

Uses docker/login-action to authenticate with the container registry (ghcr.io) using:

username: The GitHub actor performing the action.

password: The GITHUB_TOKEN secret, which allows access to the registry.

▫️ 3. Extract Metadata:

Utilizes docker/metadata-action to generate metadata for the Docker image, including tags and labels.

The id: meta allows the output of this step (tags and labels) to be reused in later steps.

The images input defines the base name for the Docker image.

▫️ 4. Build and Push Docker Image:

Uses docker/build-push-action to:

Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the repository.

Tag the image with metadata from the meta step.

Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io).

### *🔑 Purpose:*

This workflow automates the process of creating and publishing a Docker image whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. The published image is uploaded to GitHub Packages, where it can be accessed by other users or workflows.
